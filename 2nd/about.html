            <p>Thrice is an American rock band from Irvine, California, formed in 1998.
            The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue and guitarist Teppei 
            Teranishi while they were in high school. Early in their career, the band was known 
            for fast, hard music based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, 
            and frequent changes in complex time signatures. This style is exemplified on their second 
            album, The Illusion of Safety (2002) and their third album The Artist in the Ambulance (2003). 
            Their fourth album Vheissu (2005) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats, 
            keyboards, and a more experimental sound. In 2007 and 2008, Thrice released The Alchemy Index, 
            consisting of two studio albums that together make a 4-part, 24-song cycle. Each of the four
            6-song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles, based on different 
            aspects of the band's musical aesthetic which reflect the elemental themes of fire, water, air 
            and earth, both lyrically and musically. The band's seventh album, entitled Beggars, was released 
            on August 11, 2009, and their eighth, Major/Minor on September 20, 2011.</p>
            <p>The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band's different experiments 
            and explorations. In 2011, Thrice announced a final tour and an imminent hiatus. Kensrue and 
            Teranishi decided to reform the band in 2015. In 2016, Thrice released their first post-reunion 
            album, To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere. Each album released by Thrice has had a portion of its 
            sales proceeds donated to a new charitable organization</p>
